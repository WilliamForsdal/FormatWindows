### Prepare
Before reinstalling windows the following should be considered:

1. Drivers and other software
   
   Download all drivers and software needed before reinstalling windows. This makes the process afterward easier.
   * [Ninite](https://ninite.com/)
   * [Speedcrunch](http://www.speedcrunch.org/)
   * [ConEmu - better windows terminal](https://conemu.github.io/)
   * [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/)
  
2. Windows activation

   How will windows be activated? Know this before reinstalling.
  
3. Media creation tool

   Use the Media creation tool [from here](https://www.microsoft.com/sv-se/software-download/windows10) to put the windows installer on a 8GB USB disk.
  
4. Disconnect hard drives

   Disconnect all hard drives except the one that windows will be installed on. This eliminates the risk of formatting the wrong hard drive, and also makes it impossible for the windows installer to install files on other disks during the setup.
  
### Install windows
When the preparation is finished install windows on the selected hard drive.

### Install software
Install the software you want to have installed.
